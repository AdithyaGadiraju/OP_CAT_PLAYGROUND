## Purpose
Demo playground app to visualise the basics of how concatonation works.
Especially OP_CAT, bitcoins original concatenate opcode that was disabled in 2010.

## How to open and use
Open the HTML file in a browser of your choice.

App is pretty self explanatory but includes:
1. Adding cats to the stack
2. Performing OP_CAT functionality to concatenate "stack items"
3. Stack item limit if too many cats are added to one stack item
4. Removing cats to start again
